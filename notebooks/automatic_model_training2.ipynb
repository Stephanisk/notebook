        "After the model finishes training, the auto training script will automatically convert it to ONNX and tflite versions, saving them as `my_custom_model/<model_name>.onnx/tflite` in the present working directory, where `<model_name>` is defined in the YAML training config file. Either version can be used as normal with `openwakeword`. I recommend testing them with the [`detect_from_microphone.py`](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord/blob/main/examples/detect_from_microphone.py) example script to see how the model performs!"
